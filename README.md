# B Kidu Pizza

### A touch by Wagalla Nixon

Welcome!!

B Kidu is an online restaurant that allows users to place thier order and choose a topping they prefer. The website is meant to enhance skills in Bootstrap, Javascript and JQuery. The Website has been built and created with ultimate care, but, as always, man is to error. Some parts of the website may appear lightly touched but just enjoy viewing and studying the site.
